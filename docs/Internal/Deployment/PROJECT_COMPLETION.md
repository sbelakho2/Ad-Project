# Rival ApexMediation – Archived Deliverable Inventory

> **Status:** Archived on 2025-11-18. This file previously advertised the program as "production ready" with a detailed feature matrix. It is now superseded by `docs/Internal/Deployment/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

## Original Intent

- Compare platform capabilities against Unity LevelPlay feature-by-feature.
- Enumerate deliverables across frontend, backend, SDKs, infrastructure, CI/CD, and observability.
- Document go-to-market claims (support tiers, pricing, migration incentives).

## Why It Changed

- The claims were written before the risk inventory in `AD_PROJECT_FILE_ANALYSIS.md` and the FIX backlog existed, so they no longer reflect reality.
- Maintaining three separate "completion" narratives created ambiguity for auditors and new contributors.

## Where to Find Accurate Information

1. **Canonical status:** `docs/Internal/Deployment/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
2. **Execution backlog:** `docs/Internal/Development/FIXES.md`
3. **Evidence log:** `docs/Internal/Development/AD_PROJECT_FILE_ANALYSIS.md`

Any updates about readiness, comparisons, or customer promises must include links to those artifacts (or test runs/PRs) and reference the relevant FIX ID.
